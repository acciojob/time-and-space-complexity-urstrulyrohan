	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        When we analyze algorithms, one of the key factors we consider is their time complexity.
        Time complexity refers to how efficiently an algorithm performs based on the input size.
        Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, allowing them to handle larger inputs without significant slowdowns.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to time complexity, we also need to consider the <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm.
        Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size.
        Algorithms with better space complexity use less memory, which is crucial for optimizing memory usage in resource-constrained environments.
        For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
